# nouha-lang
Nouha is an experimental programming language born from a personal human experience. A developer, unable to express his emotions with words, chose to write them in code. Each line carries meaning, each program is like a short story. Nouha is not about performance or technical complexity — it is about feeling, meaning, and expression.
